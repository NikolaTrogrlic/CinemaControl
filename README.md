 ## Possible Questions
 
> How do I install?

Head over to the Installer folder in the project files and download the installer. Once downloaded follow the steps and it should work.

> How do I add an OMDB Key for the OMDB Fill feature ?

Head over to https://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx and grab a free key.
 
> I set a security key for the database information but forgot it!
 
When prompted for the security key, click the X button of the window and then re-enter the information

> The program is missing X feature. Can you add it?

This was a proof of concept for a school project but I most likely will not be updating this project as it is using outdated technology.
However, anybody is free to make changes to it or even make your own APP using this as your base.
